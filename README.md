Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. In Spain, cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death, with 230.5 death events per 100,000 inhabitants. 
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. In this project, I will analyze the relationship between following features and the death event:
1) Anaemia 
2) Diabetes 
3) Ejection fraction
4) High blood pressure 
6) Serum creatinine 
7) Serum Sodium 
8) Smoking
